Hi there! My name is Nha Do and I am currently a student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCLA.

I am interested in Digital Signal Processing, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Analysis and their applications in Speech Recognition and Computer Vision.

My current project is to focus on training End-to-end model using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with Transformer. I am working as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the Speech Processing and Auditory Perception Laboratory under the supervision of Professor Abeer Alwan and Ph.D students.

In my free time, I enjoy writing and playing sport. I have my personal blog, which has been written mostly by Vietnamese, where I share stories about my career and social life also. I am planning to have English version soon. You can find the link to my blog on the bottom of this page or check it out [here](https://nhavtdo.wordpress.com/).
