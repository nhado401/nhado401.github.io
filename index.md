Hi there! My name is Nha Do. I graduated from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) with Electrical Engineering major, specializing in Digital Signal Processing, Data Analytics and Applied Machine Learning. Born and raised in Vietnam before moving to Los Angeles and then Dallas. 

I am currently a Data Engineer working at AT&T Chief Data Office in Plano/ Dallas as a data architect to provide scalable, reliable, secured and curated data solutions to bring AT&T data to the world-class level.

I spent the summer of 2022 with AT&T Labs in Middletown, New Jersey where I worked as a Network and Data Engineer Intern in Big Data team.

In summer 2021, I worked as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the UCLA Speech Processing and Auditory Perception Laboratory focusing on training and evaluating the End-to-end model using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with Transformer to analyze and understand children dialect.

You can navigate to "My Notes" tab on the top right of this page to read my technical notes about some of my past and current work. I like documenting what I have done (even though I don't have time to do it for all of my work) and share my experience with people. I hope to receive your feedback, comment or any contribution.

In my free time, I enjoy writing and playing sport. I have my personal blog, which has been written mainly by Vietnamese, where I share stories about my career and social life also. I am planning to have English version soon. You can find the link to my blog on the bottom of this page or check it out [here](https://nhavtdo.wordpress.com/).
