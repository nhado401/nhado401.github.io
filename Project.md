## Plant Pathology - Machine Learning on Embedded System (In Progress)

Create a deep learning model to classify diseases in apple trees on Microcontroller STM32 H743ZI2 board.

## Handwritten Digits Recognition (2021) - Python, C - STM32 H743ZI2

Created and trained a machine learning model to classify handwritten digits in Python.

Designed and developed the Convolutional layer, Max pooling layer and Dense layer in C.

Embedded the weights and biases and tested the model on Microcontroller STM32 H743ZI2 board.


## Spam Email Classification (2021) - Python

Built a model to classify an email to be spam or non-spam based on Naiive Bayes Theorem.

Optimized the model by using Scikit-learn library

Accuracy: 97%

## House Prices Prediction (2021) - Python

Extracted, analyzed and visualized the dataset.
Developed a data transformation to optimize the Linear Regression Model.
Built a valuation tool for the prices prediction.

## Fire Warning Device (2016) - C

Developed an electronic device using Micro-controller 8051

The device is a combination of measuring temperature, humidity, gas, current and displays on a LCD soldiered on the
circuit.

The device will alarm through a speaker when the temperature or gas concentration increases rapidly and passes the
threshold.
