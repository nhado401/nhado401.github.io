## Plant Pathology - Machine Learning on Microcontroller STM32 H743ZI2 (In Progress)

Create a deep learning model to classify diseases in apple trees and embed the weight of the pre-trained model into Microcontroller STM32 H7 board.

## Spam Email Classification (2021)

Programming Language: Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Source of Dataset: Spam Assassin Public Corpus.

Built a model to classify an email to be spam or non-spam based on Naiive Bayes Theorem.

Accuracy: 97%

## Fire Warning Device (2016)

Programming Language: C

Developed an electronic device using Micro-controller 8051

The device is a combination of measuring temperature, humidity, gas, current and displays on a LCD soldiered on the
circuit.

The device will alarm through a speaker when the temperature or gas concentration increases rapidly and passes the
threshold.
